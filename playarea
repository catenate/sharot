Play area.  In addition to a side for each player, the playing area
for 2–4 players consists of a shared area between each player.
This approach makes the playing area complicated for 6 people.
In addition, smaller tables don’t well support a large number of shares.
In these cases, play with one shared area between all players.

Alternative play area.  Instead of shares and sides around players,
another way to arrange the cards is all in a row of card stacks,
with markers to indicate which players count the cards in the stack.
To score, divide the number of arcane points in each stack by the
number of players who count it.  Each marker and combination of two
should be represented, to record points on sides and shares.
