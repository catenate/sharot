In addition to a side for each player, the playing area for 2–4 players
consists of a shared area between each player.

This approach makes the playing area complicated for 5 or more people.
In addition, smaller tables don’t well support a large number of sides.
In these cases, play with one shared area between all players, and
watch out for Lovers.

Instead of shares and sides around players, another way to arrange the
cards is all in a row of card stacks, with markers to indicate which
players count the cards in the stack.  To score, divide the number of
arcane points in each stack by the number of players who count it.
