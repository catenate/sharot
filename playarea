Play area.  The playing area for 2–4 players consists of a side for
each player, a shared area between each pair of players, a face-down
draw pile, and a face-down pile for cards removed from play.

Alternative play area.  This approach makes the playing area
complicated for 6 people.  In addition, smaller tables don’t well
support a large number of shares.  In these cases, play with one
shared area between all players.  Instead of shares and sides around
players, another way to arrange the cards is all in a row of card
stacks, with markers to indicate which players count the cards in the
stack.  To score, divide the number of arcane points in each stack by
the number of players who count it.  Each marker and combination of
two should be represented, to record points on sides and shares.
