Each V and X on cards, and each group of 5 points directly on a share
or side, comprise arcane knowledge, which leads to madness.  The fewer
arcane points you have, the more sane you are.

All arcane points on a player’s side count towards that player’s score.
Half the arcane points in areas shared with one other player count
towards a player’s score.  When you need to divide an odd number of
points by 2, round down.

For one common area, in games of 5 or more players, the number of
arcane points in the share which count towards each player is the
total arcane points divided by the number of players.  (This should be
the most complicated calculation in the game).

To keep up with the number of points on a share or side, you can use
Sharot dice with sides I, II, III, IIII, V and X; or use ordinary dice, counting
the 6 as 10.  Twist the I sideways for a negative sign.
