Each turn.  “Each turn” effects happen at the beginning of the turn,
in order by increasing card number.

Tactics.  Play cards to (as of the end of the game) minimize arcane
points on your side and minimize arcane points shared with each
other player.

Play effects.  Cards may play anywhere unless limited by their
effects, and specifically may join a stack with Tower or World.  Play
as many effects as you can; a card may play with no effect.  Follow
the order of effects on cards, it usually makes a difference.

Stacks.  Cards which affect only one card may affect one card in a
stack, limited by the effects of Tower and World.  If a card plays in
place of another, and that card cannot move, the playing card joins
its card stack.
