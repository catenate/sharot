Competitive as it stands, but there could be a coöperative game lurking
in there somewhere, with some rules about how the remainder of the
deck not held by players should play itself.

Since there is hidden information (the cards in players’ hands), and
cards go in and out of players’ hands during the game, I’m not sure
how well that would translate to remote play.

Instead of shares and sides around players, another way to arrange the
cards is all in a row of card stacks, with markers to indicate which
players count the cards in the stack.  To score, divide the number of
arcane points in each stack by the number of players who count it.

Each release in the series could be another themed set of tarot.
With the same back, users can mix and match one card of each
point value from one of the sets, 24 cards total representing all
point values.  In this approach each release is a self-contained game,
which requires new and interesting card effects for each card.
(Keep notes on early variations for further development.)
Card effects in expansion sets can explore different aspects of the
archetype at each point value; develop antitheses in tarot imagery;
implement mechanisms from processes in themes, items, and
characters; break rules established in earlier sets; and expand types
of gameplay.

Death VII visits each side and share counter-clockwise and kills a card;
