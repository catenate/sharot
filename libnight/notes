Competitive as it stands, but there could be a coöperative game lurking
in there somewhere, with some rules about how the remainder of the
deck not held by players should play itself.

Since there is hidden information (the cards in players’ hands), and
cards go in and out of players’ hands during the game, I’m not sure
how well that would translate to remote play.

Instead of shares and sides around players, another way to arrange the
cards is all in a row of card stacks, with markers to indicate which
players count the cards in the stack.  To score, divide the number of
arcane points in each stack by the number of players who count it.
