Sharot: A nightmare in the library.

Play Lovecraftian tarot cards that manipulate cards affecting you and
another, or only you, to reduce the influence of cosmic horrors and
save your sanity.

Number of players.  2–4 players with a shared area between players
(playtested), 5–8 players with one shared area (not yet playtested).
A single player with enough sufficiently-independent personalities may
play against himself.

Start play.  Shuffle and deal all cards to players’ hands (odd players
get any extra cards).  The player with Hermit plays it to any share or
side she wants.  The player to the right of that player moves the
Hermit anywhere he wants (since all shares and sides still have the
fewest number of points, 0), and then plays a card from his hand.
Play proceeds counter-clockwise.

General rules.  “Each turn” effects happen at the beginning of the
turn, in order by increasing card number.  Play cards to minimize
points on your side and points shared with each other player.
Cards may play anywhere unless limited by their effects, and
specifically may join a stack with Tower or Universe.  Follow the
order of effects on cards, it usually makes a difference.  Cards which
affect only one card may affect one card in a stack, limited by the
effects of Tower and Universe.

Play area.  In addition to a side for each player, the playing area
for 2–4 players consists of a shared area between each player.
This approach makes the playing area complicated for 5 or more people.
In addition, smaller tables don’t well support a large number of sides.
In these cases, play with one shared area between all players,
and watch out for Lovers.

Scoring.  Points count arcane knowledge, which leads to madness—
the fewer points you have, the more sane you are.  All points on the
side of a player count towards a player’s score.  Half of the points
on each of the areas shared with other players count towards a
player’s score.  For one common area, in games of 5 or more players,
the number of points in the share for each player is the total divided
by the number of players, which should be the most complicated
calculation in the game.

Winner.  The goal is to have the least points at the end of the game,
which makes the resolution of the game simpler.  To declare a winner,
all players have to count their points only up to the count of the
player with the least points, and then note that they have an
undefined number of additional points.  If your score is less than zero,
you actually retain a functioning mind—congratulations!
