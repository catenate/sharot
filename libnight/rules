Sharot: A nightmare in the library.

Play vaguely Lovecraftian tarot cards that manipulate cards affecting
you and another, or only you, to reduce the influence of cosmic horrors
and possibly save your sanity.

../players

Start play.  Shuffle and deal all cards to players’ hands (odd players
get any extra cards).  The player with Hermit plays it to any share or
side she wants.  The player to the right of that player moves the
Hermit anywhere he wants (since all shares and sides still have the
fewest number of arcane points, 0), and then plays a card from
his hand.  Play proceeds counter-clockwise.

../scoring

Winner.  The goal is to score the least points at the end of the game.
If your score is less than zero, you actually retain a functioning mind—
congratulations, you’ll notice when it’s eaten by your alien overlords!
