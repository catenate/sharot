Each release in the series could be another themed set of tarot.
With the same back, users can mix and match one card of each
point value from one of the sets, 24 cards total representing all
point values.

In this approach each release is a self-contained game, which requires
new and interesting card effects for each card.  (Keep notes on early
variations for further development.)

Card effects in expansion sets can explore different aspects of the
archetype at each point value; develop antitheses in tarot imagery;
implement mechanisms from processes in themes, items, and
characters; break rules established in earlier sets; and expand types
of gameplay.

Expansion card examples.  The actual card name is the same, to
reinforce the point that only one card at each point value is used to
construct a deck for play.  It might be interesting to play only one
card from a balanced pair, to prevent a card from having a counter.

Three expansion mechanic themes.  Libnight: A night in the library;
Lovecraftian cosmic horror; move cards around.  Starred: The stars our
destiny; science fiction and future technology; manipulate points on
sides and shares.  Plaything: The playâ€™s the thing; Shakespearean
scenes; call other cards.
