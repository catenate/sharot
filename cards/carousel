Fortune	XI

[A night-mare impaled on a spear.]

Immediately play under a just-played card.  Each other player
counter-clockwise replays that card.


A replayed card added to a stack with Tower stops replaying.  A player
may play Truth to replay other cards, and then use other cards to
replay Truth, et cetera, only so long as it makes a difference in the
card layout.
