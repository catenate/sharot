Hermit	VIIII

[Outsider: I have a photo of a child's green tattered zombie costume
lurching toward the camera.]

In hand: your turn is next.  EACH TURN move this card
to share or side with fewest arcane points.

The player dealt Hermit plays it as the first play of the game.
At the beginning of each turn, pick up Hermit before counting points
on each side.  The card alone moves to the share or side with fewest
arcane points.  If more than one share or side has identically fewest
arcane points, then the current player decides where to move the card.
