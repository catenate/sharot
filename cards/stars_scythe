Death	XV	killcard subpoints replacecard

[A sickle reaping wheat.]

Remove a card from play.  Also reduce points on side or share by
cardâ€™s points.  Play in its place.

This card affects Tower and World, and other cards in their stacks.
Death removes the card entirely from play, so its effects and points
no longer affect the game.  In addition, subtract the point value of
the card from the number of points on its share or side.
