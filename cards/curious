Fool	XXIIII/0·

[Cartoon style.  A student with a lantern in a dark library.]

x0 This card stack has no point sum.
XXIIII This card alone.


When played as part of a card stack, multiply the point sum of the
card stack by zero.  When played alone, on any side or share,
its point value is 24.  This means that it can’t be combined with any
other cards and keep its value of 24.
