Tower	XVIII	cardstack addside notonshare sharepoint ownerwins

This card stack can only be on a side.  It is its own side, and shares
half its points with the larger side it’s on.

If the side of the Tower has the least points at the end of the game,
then the player of the larger side it’s on wins the game.
