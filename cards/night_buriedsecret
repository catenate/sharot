Master	I	covercard uncoverplay sideowner

[An opened grave.]

Play on a side.  Put a card from your hand face down under this card.
When uncovered, it flips and enters play by the sideâ€™s owner.

The face-down card is considered out of play until Master no longer
covers the card.  At that point turn it face up.  It enters play as if
played on that side by the owner of that side.  Immediate effects and
just-played effects may be used as it enters and finishes play.
