Sun	XXI

[Sketch style.  Desert, high dunes, no life.]

Shuffle and deal a side’s cards to players’ hands.  Play on that side.


Pick up all cards on the side.  Play Sun after you distribute all the
other cards.  A player may play Sun to replay other cards, and then
use other cards to replay Sun, et cetera, only so long as the overall
game position does not repeat.
