Master	I

[An opened grave.]

Put a card from your hand face down under this card.  It flips and
enters play when uncovered.


The face-down card is considered out of play until Magus is no longer
covering the card.  At that point turn it face up, and it enters play
as if played on that share or side.  Immediate effects and just-played
effects may be used as it enters and finishes play.
