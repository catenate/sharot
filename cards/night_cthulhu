Devil	XVI

[Watercolor style.  Cthulhu: huge, lidless, expressionless deep-squid
eye; tentacled and wormy mouthparts; tattered leathery bat wings.]

Move a card stack to each other side from a side.  Play on that side.

Move only as many card stacks as there are other players.  Devil does
not move, because it does not play until after stacks move.
