Temperance	XIIII

[The king in yellow: Seven layers of tattered bright yellow rags
falling in disarray from a thin, hunched figure wearing a silken,
smooth and featureless, pallid mask.  Photographic: A doll wearing
treated fabric, against the background of a fluted granite column
(just an idea, not especially convinced of it).]

Play on a side.  Move a card stack from that side to each of
its shares.

Share only as many card stacks as there are other players.
Temperance may share, because it plays before stacks move.
