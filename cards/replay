Master	I

[Sketch style.  Abdul Hazrat: Well-kept, devout, not ostentatious
Arab religious scholar at height of Islamic culture.  Intricate Arab
mathematical tile patterns in background, but wrong somehow,
as if the math doesn't quite work.]

Play this card in place of another.  Replay that card.


A player may play Master to replay other cards, and then use
other cards to replay Master, et cetera, only so long as the overall
game position does not repeat.
