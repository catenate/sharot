Judgement	XXII

[Cartoon style.  Newly-robed student gleeful, arms wide to churning storm.]

Play to a share.  The share’s players switch hand and position.


The simplest way to do this is to have the two players put face down their
hand of cards on each side, then get up and sit in each other’s seats.
Play continues counter-clockwise from the hand that held Judgement,
so the player who played Judgement might play again, in a different
position and with a different hand.  If more than two players own the share,
the player of Judgement chooses which two players switch.
