Severity	XVII

[An expedition arrives at the broken remains of another.]

Immediately play under a just-played card.  Each other player
counter-clockwise replays that card.


Tower does not replay.  A replayed card added to a stack with Tower
stops replaying.  A player may play Severity to replay other cards,
and then use other cards to replay Severity, et cetera, only so long
as the overall game position does not repeat.
