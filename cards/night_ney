World	XXIII

Woodblock style.  A Turkish ney is an Arabian end-blown flute
consisting of a piece of hollow cane or reed with five or six finger
holes and one thumb hole.  (The instrument creates a breathy,
high thin piping for Azathoth.)

Replay all cards from a side.  Play this card on that side.  It does not
move, replay, or share.

Play Universe after you replay all the other cards, so none of the
replayed cards are played on Universe.  While the cards are replayed,
the Universe card is effectively hidden.  Other cards may be moved or
replayed from a stack containing Universe.  In general, do not move,
replace, replay, or share Universe.  Any other cards in Universeâ€™s
stack may be affected by a card, which would separate Universe from a
card in his stack, or the remainder of his stack.
