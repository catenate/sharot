Mercy	V

[Cartoon style.  Student with hands over ears, closed eyes and mouth.]

As a card plays, play on that player’s side.  Cancel its effects,
not its points—which play freely.


Mercy cancels all the effects of any card as it plays.
This includes the effects of cards which change point sums,
so such cards are worth just their face point value.  This nullifies
restrictions on how the card may play, move, replay, or share.
To note that the card is only points, turn it upside down.
