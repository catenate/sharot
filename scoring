Arcane points.  Each V and X on cards, and each group of 5 points directly
on a share or side, comprise arcane knowledge, which leads to madness.
The fewer arcane points you have, the more sane you are.

Scoring sides and shares.  All arcane points on a player’s side count
towards that player’s score.  Half the arcane points in areas shared
with one other player count towards a player’s score.  When you need
to divide an odd number of points by 2, round down.  Points on a share
or side can go negative, e.g. to offset points from cards.

Scoring a common share.  For one common area, in games of 6 players,
the number of arcane points in the share which count towards each
player is the total arcane points divided by the number of players.
(This should be the most complicated calculation in the game).

Scoring dice.  To keep up with the number of points on a share or
side, you can use Sharot dice, with sides I, II, III, IIII, V and X.
Twist I sideways as a negative sign.  Or, use ordinary dice, counting
the 6 as 10.
