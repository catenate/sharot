Each player has an area of the table directly in front of him that
represents his reputation.  Each pair of players adjacent clockwise
and counter-clockwise also have areas between them, which represent
their associations.  Each reputation and association area can host
cards and counters, which represent damage to their reputatations or
associations.  The count of this damage can only be positive.  The
winner is the player at the end of the game with the lowest total
damage to their reputations and associations.  The count of damage to
a reputation is the sum of the value on each card in the reputation
area, and the count directly in the reputation area itself.  The full
value of reputation damage counts against the reputation of its
player.  Likewise, the count of damage to an association is the sum of
the value on each card in the association area, and the count directly
in the association area itself.  Half the count of damage to an
association is added to each of the association’s players.
