Each turn.  “Each turn” effects happen at the beginning of the turn,
in order by increasing card number.

Tactics.  Play cards to (as of the end of the game) minimize arcane
points on your side and minimize arcane points shared with each
other player.

Play effects.  Cards may play anywhere unless limited by their
effects, and specifically may join a stack with effects which limit
move, replay, or share.  Play as many effects as you can; a card may
play with no effect.  Follow the order of effects on cards, it usually
makes a difference.

Stacks.  Cards which affect only one card may attempt to affect a
single card in a stack, and be prevented by effects which limit move,
replay, or share.  If a card plays in place of another, and that card
cannot move, the playing card joins its card stack.
