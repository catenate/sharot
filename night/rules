Sharot: A nightmare in the library.

Play vaguely Lovecraftian tarot cards that manipulate cards affecting
you and another, or only you, to reduce the influence of cosmic horrors
and possibly save your sanity.

Number of players.  2–4 players with a shared area between players
(playtested).  6 players with one shared area (not yet playtested).
A single player with sufficiently many and independent personalities
may play against himself.

Play area.  In addition to a side for each player, the playing area
for 2–4 players consists of a shared area between each player.
This approach makes the playing area complicated for 6 people.
In addition, smaller tables don’t well support a large number of shares.
In these cases, play with one shared area between all players.

Alternative play area.  Instead of shares and sides around players,
another way to arrange the cards is all in a row of card stacks,
with markers to indicate which players count the cards in the stack.
To score, divide the number of arcane points in each stack by the
number of players who count it.  Each marker and combination of two
should be represented, to record points on sides and shares.

Setup.  Shuffle and deal half the deck evenly to 2, 3, 4,
or 6 players.  The remainder comprises a draw pile.

Deal 6 to each of 2 players, leaving 12 for draw pile.
Deal 4 to each of 3 players, leaving 12 for draw pile.
Deal 3 to each of 4 players, leaving 12 for draw pile.
Deal 2 to each of 6 players, leaving 12 for draw pile.

Play and draw.  Each turn, a player plays 1 card from hand and draws 1,
while there are cards in the draw pile.  Once the draw pile is exhausted,
each turn a player plays 1 card from hand.  Play continues through
players with cards in hand, until no player has any cards in hand to play.
Play proceeds clockwise.


For example, with no card effects on hands, deal (2 2 2 2 2 2) cards
to 6 players, and keep the remainder in a draw pile.

Round 1
	(2 2 2 2 2 2) in hands, (12) in deck
	each player plays 1 card from hand, and draws 1

Round 2
	(2 2 2 2 2 2) in hands, (6) in deck
	each player plays 1 card from hand, and draws 1

Round 3
	(2 2 2 2 2 2) in hands
	each player plays 1 card from hand

Round 4
	(1 1 1 1 1 1) in hands
	each player plays 1 card from hand


For example, with no card effects on hands, deal (6 6) cards
to 2 players, and keep the remainder in a draw pile.

Round 1
	deal out half of all cards, other half in draw pile
	(6 6) in hands, (12) in deck
	each player plays 1 card from hand, and draws 1

Round 2
	(6 6) in hands, (10) in deck
	each player plays 1 card from hand, and draws 1

Round 3
	(6 6) in hands, (8) in deck
	each player plays 1 card from hand, and draws 1

Round 4
	(6 6) in hands, (6) in deck
	each player plays 1 card from hand, and draws 1

Round 5
	(6 6) in hands, (4) in deck
	each player plays 1 card from hand, and draws 1

Round 6
	(6 6) in hands, (2) in deck
	each player plays 1 card from hand, and draws 1

Round 7
	(6 6) in hands
	each player plays 1 card from hand

Round 8
	(5 5) in hands
	each player plays 1 card from hand

Round 9
	(4 4) in hands
	each player plays 1 card from hand

Round 10
	(3 3) in hands
	each player plays 1 card from hand

Round 11
	(2 2) in hands
	each player plays 1 card from hand

Round 12
	(1 1) in hands
	each player plays 1 card from hand
	game over: no cards in hands


Start play.  The player with Hermit plays it to any share or side
she wants.  The player to the right of that player moves the Hermit
anywhere he wants (since all shares and sides still have the fewest
number of arcane points, 0), and then plays a card from his hand.
Each turn.  “Each turn” effects happen at the beginning of the turn,
in order by increasing card number.

Tactics.  Play cards to (as of the end of the game) minimize arcane
points on your side and minimize arcane points shared with each
other player.

Play effects.  Cards may play anywhere unless limited by their
effects, and specifically may join a stack with effects which limit
move, replay, or share.  Play as many effects as you can; a card may
play with no effect.  Follow the order of effects on cards, it usually
makes a difference.

Stacks.  Cards which affect only one card may attempt to affect a
single card in a stack, and be prevented by effects which limit move,
replay, or share.  If a card plays in place of another, and that card
cannot move, the playing card joins its card stack.

Arcane points.  Each V and X on cards, and each group of 5 points directly
on a share or side, comprise arcane knowledge, which leads to madness.
The fewer arcane points you have, the more sane you are.

Scoring sides and shares.  All arcane points on a player’s side count
towards that player’s score.  Half the arcane points in areas shared
with one other player count towards a player’s score.  When you need
to divide an odd number of points by 2, round down.

Scoring a common share.  For one common area, in games of 6 players,
the number of arcane points in the share which count towards each
player is the total arcane points divided by the number of players.
(This should be the most complicated calculation in the game).

Scoring dice.  To keep up with the number of points on a share or
side, you can use Sharot dice, with sides I, II, III, IIII, V and X.
Twist I sideways as a negative sign.  Or, use ordinary dice, counting
the 6 as 10.

Winner.  The goal is to score the least points at the end of the game.
If your score is less than zero, you actually retain a functioning mind—
congratulations, you’ll notice when it’s eaten by your alien overlords!
