A “card stack” is a set of cards played over top of each other so that
the card name and points remain visible.  Effects which move a “card
stack” move all cards in the stack.  Effects which move “one card”
remove one particular card from the stack.

“Each turn” effects happen at the beginning of the turn, in order by
increasing card number.

A “share” is an area of the table between a set (usually a pair)
of players’ sides, and is under the control of its set of players.
The points on a share are split evenly (round down) among its
players.  There are as many shared areas as there sets (usually
pairs) of players.  One way to arrange sides is as a line of cards
between the sides of each player, as in the game logo, which
illustrates a layout of 6 shares in a game of 4 players.

A “side” is an area of the table directly in front of a player, and
under that player's control.  All the points on a side belong to only
its player.  There are as many sides as there are players.
