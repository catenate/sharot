Setup.  Shuffle and deal half the deck evenly to 2, 3, 4,
or 6 players.  The remainder comprises a draw pile.

Deal 6 to each of 2 players, leaving 12 for draw pile.
Deal 4 to each of 3 players, leaving 12 for draw pile.
Deal 3 to each of 4 players, leaving 12 for draw pile.
Deal 2 to each of 6 players, leaving 12 for draw pile.

Play and draw.  Each turn, a player plays 1 card from hand and draws 1,
while there are cards in the draw pile.  Once the draw pile is exhausted,
each turn a player plays 1 card from hand.  Play continues through
players with cards in hand, until no player has any cards in hand to play.
Play proceeds clockwise.


For example, with no card effects on hands, deal (2 2 2 2 2 2) cards
to 6 players, and keep the remainder in a draw pile.
