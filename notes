Competitive as it stands, but there could be a coöperative game lurking
in there somewhere, with some rules about how the remainder of the
deck not held by players should play itself.

Since there is hidden information (the cards in players’ hands), and
cards go in and out of players’ hands during the game, I’m not sure
how well that would translate to remote play.

Wheel teens?: Replace with this card a card in play.  Take into your
hand the replaced card.

Death XIII: Replace with this card a card in play.  Remove from play
the replaced card.

Replace with this card a card in play.  Shuffle into the draw pile the
replaced card.

cheap: Replace with this card a card in play.  Put into another’s hand
the replaced card.

Tower: This card may not be replaced or moved.

Chariot VIII: Move a card in play to another side.  Play this on your side.


24 cards.  Start with one card down and out of play.  Deal 12 cards
among players.  Remaining 11 cards face-down in draw pile.
Player to left of dealer plays first: (1a) if any cards in hand, then
play and activate one held card, controlled by player, otherwise
(1b) activate one card controlled by player; then (2) draw one card.
All cards play into a common area, with bottom text area rotated to
point at controlling player.  At end of each player’s turn, number of
cards that player still controls is added to player’s score.  Skip players
with no cards in-hand or controlled.  When no player has any cards
in-hand and playable, the game ends.  Player with lowest score wins.

Generally, cards alter accumulating score to balance advantage beyond
accumulating score: cards that unduly increase number of cards on
controller’s side lower score; cards that unduly decrease the number
of cards on a controller’s side raise score; cards with constant
(don’t need activated again) effects raise and lower controller’s
score at end of each of the controlling player’s turn, whether or not
activated for any additional effects.
