“The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents’ decks
and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck.
But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become
and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains
will come your way!”

Use points on side to pay for some effect?  Some good effect that can
only be paid by adding points to your side.  Or, some bad effect you
can accept by reducing points from your side, and dealing with the bad
effect some other way (eg, pull highest-point card to your side by
subtracting that many points from your side, if you have that many
points on your side, and then move the card away if it's mobile).

Like replay a card from your side?

Starred Master imposes a cost to replay, by assuming the points of a
card onto your side to replay it.  This gets you further away from the
victory condition (fewest points) to give you an action (a frequent
mechanic in the game), which you have to balance against the
effectiveness of the action (how many points you reduce yourself by).

For example, Stars Master can add 16 points to a side and replay
Night Devil on the side, which breaks even if there are 16 points in
two mobile card stacks other than the Devil.
