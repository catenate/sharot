player clockwise from the dealer plays one of these cards, and saves
another for their hands.  Gather remaining cards, and shuffle and deal
them to all players.  Each player may play a card dealt, or one saved
from a previous round.  Repeat until all cards are played or in hand.
Play cards from hand until all cards are played.

With five players, short the dealer each round, and rotate dealership
clockwise each round.  Collect one fewer cards from the dealer,
unless a different player is short the number of cards to gather,
due to effects of the cards on hands.  Generally, a reasonably fair
mechanic is to start from the player clockwise from the dealer,
and get one card from each player who can provide one, until reaching
the number of cards to gather.
